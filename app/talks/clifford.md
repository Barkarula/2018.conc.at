Excellent real-world JavaScript performance for the web — both in the browser and server-side with Node.js — has never been more important. Over the last few years, the V8 team has learned that optimizing for the real world is different than optimizing for synthetic benchmarks. The key lesson? Consistent, good baseline performance across the entire JavaScript language is the central ingredient to a fast web.
