Ola loves speaking at conferences and meetups. She either speaks about offline first, progressive enhancement with a focus on network or web compatibility, what it's about and why it matters. She also loves to make tough tech topics understandable to everyone and enable people. Also, Ola was MC at RejectJS, 3 years in a row and otsconf.

Community is very dear to her heart as well as Open Source. This is why Ola is one of the co-founders of the OpenTechSchool Dortmund, co-organizer of RejectJS, part of CSSConfEU and creator of otsconf. Also huge supporter of the JavaScript community, diversity in tech and daugher driven development.
