We all have biases, and the tech we build is a reflection of us; we need to be aware of the exclusionary effects of dev and UX decisions. This talk is about how our biases are reflected in the software we build â€” with practical examples, and how to combat them. Software can exclude those who need our products the most. We will learn to: (1) recognize exclusionary design and development patterns, (2) identify the decision points which lead to them, the information we ask of our users, and how we use that information, and (3) combat bias, and when to leave the product-building to someone else.
