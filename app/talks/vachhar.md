In the past few years, animations on the web have evolved dramatically. We are able to create animations that generate and manipulate complex geometry, react to user input and tell captivating stories. Behind all of this amazing work is a little bit of Math.

In this session Varun will explore mathematical concepts used for creating reactive and dynamic animations. Focusing on 2D geometry, weâ€™ll dive into topics such as co-ordinate systems, polygons, solving triangles, waves &
oscillations. Making these sometimes intimidating concepts accessible to everyone.
