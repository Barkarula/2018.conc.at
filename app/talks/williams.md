Server-side Swift is currently in its nascent phase. There are only a handful of frameworks that could be considered usable, and not many websites running on Swift in production. However, we feel there is a lot of promise in server-side Swift.

We will show what a future server-side Swift framework can look like, and how Swift's type-system and the Swift toolchain can provide a state-of-the-art web development experience that in some respects can be even better than what most tools and languages offer today.

The entire codebase for this framework has been open-sourced here http://github.com/pointfreeco, and is currently being used to build the site https://www.pointfree.co, a video series on functional programming and Swift.
